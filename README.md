# Web Development Portfolio Site

**Work in Progress**

The portfolio site is the capstone project for the Coursera Specialization [Web Desing for Everybody (Basics of Web Development and Coding)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design).

I chose to design and implement a single-page web development portfolio site using Bootstrap 4.


## Objectives

1. Create at least two different wireframes for the site, one for mobile view and one for a larger screen.

2. Generate original content.

3. Use the proper semantic and syntactic HTML tags to display the content.

4. Apply CSS to the content to create a well-styled and accessible site.

5. Write media queries and/or use a framework to create a responsive site.

6. Implement four advanced features that demonstrate the ability to apply web design theory or practice (JavaScript, plugins, Accessibility features, animation, etc.).

7. Deploy the site.


## Requirements

- The site has at least three pages or sections and links to each page or section.

- Each page or section has at least two semantic html tags.

- Each page validates at [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org) (warnings are acceptable).

- Each page is responsive, has at least two different views, one for mobile and one for a larger screen, and a unique layout for each view.

- One of the pages has at least four images.

- Each page has a layout that is easy to follow and uses a variety of colors and fonts. The site has a unique style sheet with at least nine unique CSS rules, even if a template or framework is used.

- The site has four features that go beyond what was covered in the four previous courses of the Specialization.


## Options

The capstone course gives students three options:
- Build your site from scratch,
- Build your site from a template, or
- Build your site using a framework.

I chose to build my site using Bootstrap 4 as a framework.

## Advanced Features

- [X] Add a Carousel with four images.

- [X] Add a fixed navbar to the top of the page.

- [X] Add icons to social media links.

- [X] Enhance the accessibility of the site using WebAIM's [WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool](http://wave.webaim.org).
